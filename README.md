# Some experiments with STM32LRC and Embassy

This is a repo to just give a try for things in embedded. You should not use this code or any code in this account.

Things needed for this work -

1. STM32 board
2. A decent micro USB cable (I used a UGREEN micro usb cable)
3. A lot of patience and ability to look foolish in asking basic questions
